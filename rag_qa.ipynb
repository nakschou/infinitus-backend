Here is the secret to success: have a great product.', 'No first-time founder knows what he or she is doing. To the degree you understand that, and\\nask for help, you’ll be better off. It’s worth the time investment to learn to become a good\\nleader and manager. The best way to do this is to find a mentor—reading books doesn’t\\nseem to work as well. A surprising amount of our advice at YC is of the form “just ask them” or “just do it”. First-time\\nfounders think there must be some secret for when you need something from someone or\\nyou want to do some new thing. But again, startups are where tricks stop working. Just be\\ndirect, be willing to ask for what you want, and don’t be a jerk. It’s important that you distort reality for others but not yourself. You have to convince other\\npeople that your company is primed to be the most important startup of the decade, but you\\nyourself should be paranoid about everything that could go wrong. Be persistent. Most founders give up too quickly or move on to the next product too quickly. If\\nthings generally aren’t going well, figure out what the root cause of the problem is and make\\nsure you address that. A huge part of being a successful startup CEO is not giving up\\n(although you don’t want to be obstinate beyond all reason either—this is another apparent\\ncontradiction, and a hard judgment call to make.)\\nBe optimistic. Although it’s possible that there is a great pessimistic CEO somewhere out in\\nthe world, I haven’t met him or her yet. A belief that the future will be better, and that the\\ncompany will play an important role in making the future better, is important for the CEO to\\nhave and to infect the rest of the company with. This is easy in theory and hard in the\\npractical reality of short-term challenges.', 'One of the most consistent\\npieces of feedback we get from YC founders is it’s harder than they could have ever\\nimagined, because they didn’t have a framework for the sort of work and intensity a startup\\nentails. Joining an early-stage startup that’s on a rocketship trajectory is usually a much\\nbetter financial deal. On the other hand, starting a startup is not in fact very risky to your career—if you’re really\\ngood at technology, there will be job opportunities if you fail. Most people are very bad at\\nevaluating risk. I personally think the riskier option is having an idea or project you’re really\\npassionate about and working at a safe, easy, unfulfilling job instead. To have a successful startup, you need: a great idea (including a great market), a great team,\\na great product, and great execution.']\n"

You will burn reputation and waste time. Don’t get demoralized if you struggle to raise money. Many of the best companies have\\nstruggled with this, because the best companies so often look bad at the beginning (and they\\nnearly always look unfashionable.) When investors tell you no, believe the no but not the\\nreason. And remember that anything but “yes” is a “no”—investors have a wonderful ability to\\nsay “no” in a way that sounds like “maybe yes”. It’s really important to have fundraising conversations in parallel—don’t go down a list of your\\nfavorite investors sequentially. The way to get investors to act is fear of other investors taking\\naway their opportunity. View fundraising as a necessary evil and something to get done as quickly as possible. Some founders fall in love with fundraising; this is always bad. It’s best to have just one\\nfounder do it so the company doesn’t grind to a halt. Remember that most VCs don’t know much about most industries. Metrics are always the\\nmost convincing. It’s beginning to change, but most investors (Y Combinator being a notable exception)\\nunfortunately still require introductions from people you both know to take you seriously. Insist on clean terms (complicated terms compound and get worse each round) but don’t\\nover-optimize, especially on valuation.
